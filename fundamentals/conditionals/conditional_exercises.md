# Conditional Exercises

1. Write a block of code that checks and logs whether variables are equal or not.

2. Write a block of code that logs which of two number variables is larger.
  * Your output should look like this (in this example for the numbers x = 5 and y = 10): 'The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10'
  * If the two numbers are equal, log: 'The numbers are equal.'
 
3. Create a string variable with a language code (e.g. "english", "spanish", "german"). 
Use an if - else if - else statement to log "Hello, World" in the given language, for at least 3 languages. 
It should default to logging English.

4. Do question 3 again but this time use a `switch` statement. 

5. Create a variable numGrade that will contain a numeric grade (out of 100). 
Use an if - else if ... - else statement to log the corresponding letter grade, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".

6. Create two variables: animalName ('cat', 'dog', etc.) , and numberOfAnimals.

  * the number

  * either in single or plural form. Exp: "5 cats" or "1 dog".

Bonus: Make it handle a few collective nouns like "sheep" and "geese".

7. Write a block of code that logs whether a given number is even or odd.

9. Write a block of code that checks and logs whether a given number is positive, negative, or equal to 0.
