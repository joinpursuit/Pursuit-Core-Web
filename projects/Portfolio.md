# Personal & Project Portfolio Website 

## Intro

As part of job-readiness, you will be building a personal portfolio site! This site should showcase the work you've been doing at Pursuit, as well as tell potential employers about yourself. 

We find that having a personal site makes a big difference in responses from employers, especially for those trying to get their first jobs. It's also a way to show off your CSS abilities, and the projects you have built in your time here.

Making your portfolio site should be fun - it's going to be an extension of yourself. Make it personal. Get creative! Spend time on making it look good. The details really make a difference. 

## Requirements

The following items are required for your portfolio site to be considered complete.

### A) Pages or sections

You can choose to make your site one long page broken up into sections. Your website should have the following sections/pages/components.

1. **Nav Bar**:
A navigation bar with links that takes the user to other pages in your website. If your website is one long page make sure the user gets scrolled down when clicking on section links. You can get creative here!

2. **Landing/Home Page**:
Your homepage is the first page that appears when the site loads. You know what a homepage is. You can put whatever you want here!

3. **About/Intro**:
The about page is where you get to talk about yourself. Do you have a pop pitch? This is the place to put it. Write a bio. Show a picture. Talk about your love of cats, books, or milkshakes. Make this part personal. You can have combine this section wit your landing page if it makes sense.

4. **Projects**:
This section is where you put projects you've worked on during your time at Pursuit and personal projects you may have. Link to each project's GitHub repo, include a screenshot, and write a description. If the project is deployed, include a link to the live version.

  Any projects you link to from your portfolio site should have a readme file in the repo. See [Writing Good Readmes](./WritingGoodReadmes.md) for an explanation of why you should care.

5. **Skills and/or Technologies**:
Here include a list of skills and technologies you are familiar with, like: JavaScript, Node, React, Express PostgreSQL etc. You can find icon images to accompany this.

6. **Contact links**:
Include icon links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Resume and email. This is generally put at the bottom of your page as a footer or in a contact me section. A good font with tons of icons is [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

1. **Other**: (Optional) Anything else with things you may want to include, if you write, then a blog section, if you paint or photograph then a gallery section etc.

### B) Deployed online

Your portfolio site must be deployed on the internet! The easiest way to get people to look at your work is to send them a link that showcases everything. Once you have online link make sure to put it on your resume, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

We suggest deploying using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can also use heroku, but unless you're building a backend (which isn't required) it's easier not to.

### C) Use a custom domain 

There are lots of sites out there that will sell you a domain name! Here are a couple we suggest:

* [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
* [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/domains/domain-name-search)
* [Hover.com](https://hover.com)
* [Name.com](https://name.com)

Most domains are around $15 a year.

Your domain should be professional-sounding and could even have your name in it! There are tons of TLDs to choose from - .com, .dev, .io, .restaurant. Find a creative, interesting combination.

#### Personal Website Names Examples:
| Bad ✗           | Good ✔         |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| divapixie.party | josecampos.dev |
| tuffguy4.dev    | jacobshaba.zz  |
| angelicgrrl.com | erik-codes.com |

When in doubt, ask an instructor or PM! 

> Some two-letter TLDs can only be purchased from specific sites - so hover or google domains may not sell them. So if you come up with a great idea that includes a two-letter domain, you'll have to search for the site that sells it!

[Here's a list of all the available TLDs](./https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains): note that not everything on this list is available for sale.

Once you've purchased a custom domain, you need to configure it to point to github pages or netlify. This will require you to login to the site you bought the domain from and change the DNS records.

See the following links for an overview of how to do that:

* [Github Pages - About Custom Domains](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages)
* [Github Pages - Managing a Custom Domain](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
* [Hover - Managing DNS records](https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217282457-Managing-DNS-records-)
* [Name.com - All help (see DNS section)](https://www.name.com/support/categories/200296808-Domains)


### D) Responsive Design

Mobile devices make up more than half of all web traffic now. If your site isn't responsive, you're under-serving a whole lot of users. 

Additionally, employers want to see that you can build a site responsively, especially if you're going for a front-end job. Get out those media queries and flex (box)!

Use the developer tools and resize your browser to see how your site looks at various widths.

One suggestion: design your site with mobile in mind first. It's much easier to expand things than it is to squish them.

You can also use a framework to help with the layout. Since they are all using flexbox and grid internally you don't NEED to use any of these, but they do have some nice features. These are the three most popular: [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) & [Foundation](https://get.foundation/)
